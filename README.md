# ðŸ“‰ Insights from Failed Orders â€“ Data Science Challenge

This project investigates failed ride orders from **Gett** (formerly GetTaxi), analyzed as part of a StrataScratch takeâ€‘home assignment used in their data science recruitment process ---

## ðŸš— Context

Gett is a Ground Transportation Management (GTM) platform. When a customer places an order, the system attempts to match it with available drivers. This analysis focuses on **orders that did not complete successfully**â€”i.e. the customer never received a ride :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## Dataset

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. **Failure Reason Distribution**:
   - Classify failures into:
     - Cancelled Before Driver Assignment  
     - Cancelled After Driver Assignment  
     - System Rejected  
   - Determine which category has the highest count.

2. **Hourly Failure Trends**:
   - Visualize when failures occur most frequently.
   - Identify hours with abnormal failure spikes and possible causes.

3. **Cancellation Timing**:
   - Compute average cancellation times, segmented by driver-assigned status and hour.
   - Inspect and handle outliers.

4. **ETA Analysis**:
   - Examine how average ETA varies by hour, and interpret operational implications.

5. **BONUS â€“ Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Using H3 hexagons and Folium, determine how many hexes (size 8) contain 80% of failed orders.
   - Visualize hexes colored by failure count on an interactive map.
